# Introduction
Since early 2020, people all over the world have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end date that this report is written, without having enough vaccines, a great number of people, particularly for those who are living in developing countries, are still exposed to COVID-19. The goal of this project is to predict the number of days each state of the United States will reach herd immunity for COVID-19. According to the definition of herd immunity, it refers to a large portion of the population in a community having become immune to a certain disease. By reaching herd immunity, it is an effective way to prevent the virus from spreading from one person to others. That is to say, in order to reach herd immunity, more and more people should take the vaccination.
